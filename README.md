# codes-for-machine-learning-course-by-Andrew-Ng
This contains my solutions for machine learning course by Andrew Ng.
If anybody feels that code is not vectorized properly they can send a patch.
For those who are doing the course please don't copy the code. First try to solve it yourself if you are not able to solve then take look at the code and try again :) .
